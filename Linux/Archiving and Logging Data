Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt.
Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.

Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives
Command to extract the TarDocs.tar archive to the current directory: 
tar -xvf TardDocs.tar
Command to create the Javaless_Doc.tar archive from the TarDocs/ directory, while excluding the TarDocs/Documents/Java directory:
	sudo tar -cvvf Javaless_Doc.tar --exclude=”Java” ./TarDocs/Documents
Command to ensure Java/ is not in the new Javaless_Docs.tar archive:
tar -tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep ‘Java’
Bonus
Command to create an incremental archive called logs_backup_tar.gz with only changed files to snapshot.file for the /var/log directory:
Critical Analysis Question
Why wouldn't you use the options -x and -c at the same with tar?

Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs
Cron job for backing up the /var/log/auth.log file:
0 6 * * 3 tar -czvvf auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log




Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts
Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
	mkdir -p ~/backups{/freeman,/diskuse,/openlist,/freedisk}
Paste your system.sh script edits below:
#!/bin/bash

# Free memory output to a free_mem.txt file
Free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt 

# Disk usage output to a disk_usage.txt file
du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt 

# List open files to a open_list.txt file
lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt 

# Free disk space to a free_disk.txt file
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
